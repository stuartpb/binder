# Binder

This is my designated name / repository for a browser extension that'd basically provide an extensible, portable, cross-service UI for Quick Dial and the like. It was originally proposed at https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/175, and is currently listed on the Unusual Studio Projects list at https://unusual.studio/projects/#faac3e93-e5b7-401d-9611-43753a711422: right now, I'm gathering my thoughts around it in issues on this repository.
